Exploration Question 1: Find all of the missing primary keys in the Ticket table. The missing values
are 16, 17, 22, and 28, so, ideally, each of those numbers should be returned.

1.SQL Server

2.The ticketnum from ticket goes from 1 to 59 but it's missing some values , instead of looking for those values i created a table called MissingNumbers with a primary key that goes from 1 to 59. Then i make a select query that will only select those values from the MissingNumbers table that are NOT IN the Ticketnum Ticket table and that's i find the misssing primary keys. I chose this appoach because it's comparing numbers , if a number is not in it will let me know and that will be the missing primary key.My solution could not work if the ticketnum where random numbers and not a list from 1 to 59 , my solution could not work if letters where included and everything at a random order.

3. 
create table missingNumbers(
MissingPrimary int primary key);

DECLARE @i INT;
set @i = 1;
WHILE @i <= 59
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO missingNumbers(MissingPrimary) VALUES (@i);
    SELECT @i = @i + 1;
END;
select * from missingNumbers;

select MissingPrimary
from missingNumbers
where MissingPrimary not in (select ticketnum from ticket);
