1. Write two different queries that find all high priority tickets that mention “time out” or “timeout” in the description,
all medium priority tickets where the description contains the words “report” or “reports”, and all low priory tickets with
the words “activation code” in the description.


a. Accomplish this task using one or more compound conditions. (2pts)

Select ticketnum, priority , description
from Ticket
where priority like 'HiGH' and description like '%time out%' or description like '%timeout%'
Or priority like 'MED' and description like '%report%' or description like '%reports%'
Or priority like 'LOW' and description like '%activation code%';



b. Use a CASE statement in the WHERE clause to find this information. (2pts)


Select ticketnum, priority , description
from Ticket
where priority in ('HIGH','MED','LOW')
and description like 
Case priority  
		WHEN 'HIGH' THEN  '%timeout%' 
		WHEN 'HIGH' THEN  '%time out%' 

		WHEN 'MED' THEN '%report%'
		WHEN 'MED' THEN '%reports%'
		WHEN 'LOW' THEN '%activation code%'
		ELSE '%' END;


2. Contractual obligations require Support Services, Inc. to close tickets for some customers within a specified time
regardless of priority. For even numbered customers whose custnum is between 1 and 17, all tickets are supposed to be
closed within 48 hours; for odd numbered customers between 1 and 17, tickets should be closed within 72 hours. Other
customers do not have a contractual obligation specified, but company policy says they should be closed within 5 days
(120 hours). Use compound conditions or an non-traditional where clause (your choice) to find all tickets where these
deadlines were not met. (If you use a CASE statement, remember that the WHEN portion can be written just like any
WHERE clause). (4pts)

select ticketnum ,custnum ,datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime) as timeopen
from Ticket
where datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime) >
case 
when custnum between 1 and 17	and custnum % 2 = 0 then  48
when custnum between 1 and 17 and custnum % 2 <> 0 then  72
else  120
end;

 or 

select ticketnum ,custnum ,datediff(SECOND,opendatetime,closedatetime)*1.0/(60*60) as timeopen
from Ticket
where datediff(SECOND,opendatetime,closedatetime)*1.0/(60*60) >
case 
when custnum between 1 and 17	and custnum % 2 = 0 then  48
when custnum between 1 and 17 and custnum % 2 <> 0 then  72
else  120
end;

or

select ticketnum ,custnum ,datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime) as timeopen
from Ticket
where (custnum between 1 and 17	and custnum % 2 = 0  and datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime)  > 48)
or (custnum between 1 and 17 and custnum % 2 <> 0 and datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime)  > 72)
or(custnum > 17 and datediff(HOUR,opendatetime,closedatetime)  > 120 )


3. Is there a customer in the database who uses the same email provider as the customer after them? Use column
addition and substrings in the WHERE clause to find any two sequential customer numbers where those customers have
the same domain in their email (for example, if customers 9 and 10 both had @wahoo.com email addresses). (2pts)

SELECT a.custnum, a.contactemail, b.custnum, b.contactemail
FROM 
  (SELECT custnum, contactemail,
    SUBSTRING(contactemail, CHARINDEX('@', contactemail) + 1, LEN(contactemail)) as email_domain,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY custnum) as row_number
  FROM Customer) a
JOIN 
  (SELECT custnum, contactemail,
    SUBSTRING(contactemail, CHARINDEX('@', contactemail) + 1, LEN(contactemail)) as email_domain,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY custnum) as row_number
  FROM Customer) b
ON a.email_domain = b.email_domain
AND a.row_number + 1 = b.row_number
ORDER BY a.custnum;
