Exploration Question 2: Is there a support rep who seems to specialize in any particular product? You
can determine the exact criteria for reaching this conclusion, but you might look at what percentage of
a repâ€™s tickets are for a given product and/or whether that rep takes tickets for a product more than
other reps do.

-- Sql Server
-- I get the percentage by dividing the sum of each product name that the representative worked on by the total of all the products done by the representative, then i multiply the result of the division by 100 to get the percentage. 
I chose this approach because it seems the most logical to know what product each representative works on the most and the least.
I don't think any changes would keep my answer from working unless there was no a connection between Supportrep and Product.



-- first option
Over and Partition By
SELECT CONCAT(sr.repfname ,' ',  sr.replname) as 'Name', 
       p.prodname ,
     concat( cast(COUNT(p.prodname) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(p.prodname)) OVER (PARTITION BY sr.repid)as float ),'%')  as 'Percentage',
      concat( COUNT(p.prodname) , '/', SUM(COUNT(p.prodname))  OVER (PARTITION BY sr.repid)  ) as 'Out of'
FROM SupportRep sr
JOIN TicketRep tr ON sr.repid = tr.repid
JOIN Ticket t ON tr.ticketnum = t.ticketnum
JOIN TicketProduct tp ON t.ticketnum = tp.ticketnum
JOIN Product p ON tp.prodcode = p.prodcode
GROUP BY sr.repid, CONCAT(sr.repfname, ' ', sr.replname), p.prodname
ORDER BY sr.repid ASC, 'Percentage' asc;


-- second option
subqueries.
Can be simplified if i remove the 'Out of' column and just leave the percentage .

       CONCAT(CAST(COUNT(p.prodname) AS float) / -- the division
